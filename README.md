# Bug-prediction-Model-Building-Using-R

This model predict the bug from a given datasets and this model will Answers Following questions from begining to end: 

# Questions-1: Do files with post-release bugs have higher complexity than files without post-release bugs? 
 EXAMPLE: files with more than 100 LOC and less than 100 LOC which files has more post_bugs?
# Questions-2: Size and pre-release defects, which has a higher correlation with post-release bugs?
# Questions-3: How well can you model post release bugs? What are the top 5 metrics in model fit? 
# Questions-4: What are the topic 5 metrics in model output?
# Questions-5: How well can you predict post release bugs?
